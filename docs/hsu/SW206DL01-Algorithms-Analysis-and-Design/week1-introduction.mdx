# Week 1: Introduction to Algorithms

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what algorithms are and why they matter
- Learn about algorithm complexity and performance analysis
- Introduction to basic algorithm design principles

## What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing a task. In computer science, algorithms are essential for processing data and performing computations efficiently.

### Key Characteristics of Algorithms

1. **Input**: Algorithms take some input data
2. **Output**: They produce a result
3. **Definiteness**: Each step must be clearly defined
4. **Finiteness**: Must terminate after a finite number of steps
5. **Effectiveness**: Each step must be executable

## Algorithm Complexity

### Time Complexity
Measures how the running time of an algorithm increases with the size of the input.

### Space Complexity
Measures how much memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size.

## Basic Examples

### Example 1: Linear Search

```javascript
function linearSearch(arr, target) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] === target) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n) - Linear time
**Space Complexity**: O(1) - Constant space

### Example 2: Binary Search

```javascript
function binarySearch(arr, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr.length - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

        if (arr[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return -1;
}
```

**Time Complexity**: O(log n) - Logarithmic time
**Space Complexity**: O(1) - Constant space

## Algorithm Analysis

### Asymptotic Notation

1. **Big O (O)**: Upper bound - worst case
2. **Big Omega (Ω)**: Lower bound - best case
3. **Big Theta (Θ)**: Tight bound - average case

### Common Time Complexities

- O(1) - Constant time
- O(log n) - Logarithmic time
- O(n) - Linear time
- O(n log n) - Linearithmic time
- O(n²) - Quadratic time
- O(2ⁿ) - Exponential time

## Next Week

In the next lecture, we'll dive deeper into algorithm complexity analysis and learn how to formally analyze the performance of algorithms.
